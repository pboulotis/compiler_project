# Cimple Compiler Project
- This project was for the course named "MYY802- Compilers".
- It's a compiler for the imaginary programming language named Cimple. 
- Further instructions for the language are found in the "Cimple.pdf" (in Greek)
- Using this python file and an .ci file, we can compile the file to assembly and possibly C code.
- For some simple .ci files that do not contain many functions the compilation process is successful.
- I also inlcuded some sample .ci files. 
- There is a very thorough report for how the whole compilation process work (also written in Greek).
